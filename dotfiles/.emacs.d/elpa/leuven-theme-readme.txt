This elegant Org-enhancing color theme "leuven" ROCKS!
... and not just for Org mode.

To use it, put the following in your Emacs configuration file:

  (load-theme 'leuven t)

Requirements: Emacs 24+.

NOTE -- Would you like implement a version of this for dark backgrounds,
please do so!  I'm willing to integrate it...
