ncmpcpp.fcl is the version with the header
ncmpcppsmall/small2 are the versions (forgot what the difference between the two are) with the bottom info bar only

email me back if the required images did not import over

since I cut most of it out from various themes found on deviantart and just changed the images and moved em around, the entire thing is very messy and you'll see bits of code from other themes

you'll need Columns UI, Panel Stack Splitter, UI Hacks, WSH Panel Mod, Windows 7 Shell integration (foo_w7shell, not too sure if you need this) and maybe some other shit email me if it still doesn't work

I also recommend Popup Panels for detachable playlists and other menus

important: make sure to use UI Hacks to lock the window at 514 pixels WIDE, height doesnt matter, when you're modding it try making it so that width is adjustable
